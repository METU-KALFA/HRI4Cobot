## Abstract
Collaborative robotic manipulators (a.k.a Cobots) are rapidly being deployed on factory floors to operate alongside human workers as their mates to reduce their physical/cognitive load. For human-robot interaction (HRI) research,  these Cobots, which are designed as open-chain manipulators to carry out manipulation tasks 24/7 at high reliability/precision, provide both an opportunity (of using Cobots as a reliable and affordable platform to conduct HRI research) and a challenge (of imbuing Cobots with HRI skills to improve their interaction with workers). In this paper, we propose two non-verbal HRI filters, namely gazing and breathing, that would transform a UR5 robot arm equipped with a two-finger gripper into a research platform for HRI research. Specifically, the Cobot gazed by pointing its gripper towards the point of attention using its last three joints, and breathed by performing an oscillatory movement with respect to a reference posture using the first three joints close to its base.
